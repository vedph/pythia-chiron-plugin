# Pythia Chiron Plugin

This plugin for [Pythia](https://github.com/vedph/pythia) leverages my Chiron system to provide phonological analysis to Pythia.

Currently as a proof of concept these plugins are limited to provide syllabic counts for all the Chiron supported languages (Greek, Latin, Italian, modern Greek).

Projects in this solution:

- `Pythia.Chiron.Plugin`: the plugin.
- `Pythia.Cli.Plugin.Chiron`: the corresponding plugin for the Pythia CLI tool.
